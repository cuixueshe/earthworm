## ⚡ Introduction

By constructing sentences with conjunctions, it helps you learn English better~ 😊

## 🚀 How To Start?

**The mentioned operations below are based on the root directory of the current project, please be attentive to ensure there are no errors!**

### Requirements

- **pnpm version >= 8**

  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```

- **Node.js version >= v20**
  > Use the version from .node-version. [Supported tools](https://github.com/shadowspawn/node-version-usage#compatibility-testing)
- **Postgres version >= 14.0.0**
- **Redis version >= 5.0.0**
- **Docker**. please make sure it is installed and running successfully on your local machine.

```bash
docker --version # Docker version 24.0.7, build afdd53b

node --version # v20+

pnpm -v # 8+
```

### Editor

#### VSCode

- Install the recommended extensions [extensions.json](./.vscode/extensions.json)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure the `.env` File

You can choose to copy the contents of `./apps/api/.env.example` to`./apps/api/.env`. note that the' example' file contains sample configuration. the main storage system's environment variable information, such as database connection address, user name, password, port, key, etc. the back-end service will read the configuration from this file, **of course you can also change it to your own configuration information**.

Windows users recommend shortcut keys to copy and paste, Linux users can operate through the following command.

#### Server

```bash
cp ./apps/api/.env.example ./apps/api/.env
```

#### Client

```bash
cp ./apps/client/.env.example ./apps/client/.env
```

### Restore Data Of Logto

Uncompress `logto_db_init_data.zip` to `.volumes/`

```bash
unzip logto_db_init_data.zip -d .volumes/
```

- Admin URL: http://localhost:3011
- Username: admin
- Password: wYJha:-eYMrAe9i

> if you want to [Manual Configuration Logto](https://github.com/cuixueshe/earthworm/wiki/%E8%BF%81%E7%A7%BB-Logto-%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%90%8E%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0%E5%90%AF%E5%8A%A8%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%EF%BC%88%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE%E8%80%85%EF%BC%89)

### 3. Start Docker Compose Service

The backend relies on Postgres and Redis services. Start and stop these services using the commands configured in `package.json` below.

```bash
# start
pnpm docker:start

# When needed, execute the following command
# stop
pnpm docker:stop
# delete
pnpm docker:delete
# Complete deletion (including Volume data)
pnpm docker:down
```

If you prefer manual, you can use the commands below.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose stop
docker compose down

# commands compatible with older versions of Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Initialize Database Schema

When executing this command, try to keep a little time from the previous command, because the `-d` parameter just used will suspend its service execution in the background. At this time, the docker service may still be running. If an error is found, execute it again.

```bash
pnpm db:init
```

### 5. Create and Upload Course Data

**Only Execute This During the Initial Database Initialization**.

```bash
pnpm db:upload
```

### 6. Start the Backend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:serve
```

### 7. Start the Frontend Service

```bash
pnpm dev:client
```

## 🛠️ About testing

**Run the test before submitting the commit, and submit the code after the test passes, so as to avoid multiple commits to solve the test problem**.

### Front-end Testing

The main is the single test of Vitest and the automated test of cypress, execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter the front-end project directory
cd apps/client

# vitest
pnpm test:unit:run
# cypress
pnpm test:e2e:run

# monitor vitest, convenient hot update to see test results
pnpm test:unit:watch
```

### Backend Testing

Mainly Jest single test and end-to-end test, but need to access the test database, so you need to ensure that:

1. testdb and testRedis services in Docker Compose started normally.
2. The configuration information in the `.env.test` file is correct. If there is no such file, you can copy the contents of the `apps/api/.env.test.example` file to the `apps/api/.env.test` file. The following command is provided to directly use.

Execute the following command:

```bash
# Enter Backend Project Directory
cd apps/api

# If you have an.env.test file, you don't need to run this step
cp .env.test.example .env.test

# Single test
pnpm test:unit
# End-to-end testing
pnpm test:e2e
# Single test and end-to-end test run together
pnpm test
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Database connection failed

My Docker and the database inside are running normally, but when I run the `db:init` command, I still report an error, indicating that the database connection failed.

You can check whether the database configuration in the `.env` file is correct, or even whether this file has it! 😠

### How To Correctly Update Course Data?

when you identify incorrect course data and make modifications, you should use the following command to update the course data in the database.

```bash
pnpm db:update
```

### pnpm Install Error?

Some dependencies require compilation during installation, necessitating the presence of relevant build environments.
If these environments are not available, the compilation process may fail. Additionally, different modules may require different build environments, so specific issues need to be analyzed individually.
Below are specific problems encountered along with their solutions.

First try the following command to update `pnpm`.

```shell
pnpm i -g
# or
pnpm i -g pnpm
# or
npx pnpm i -g pnpm@latest
```

**Error Installing the argon2 Module On Windows**

- Install Visual Studio 2015 or later, specifically the "Desktop development with C++" component. (In practice, any component containing C++ development tools and libraries will suffice.)
- If you encounter Chinese characters display issues during compilation, execute `chcp 437` in the command prompt, then rerun the install command.

### Docker Permission Denied in Docker?

When using WSL2 as a development environment in Windows, the following error occurs when starting Docker with `docker compose up -d` :

```bash
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied
```

> Solution

Add the current user to the docker group

```bash
# Add docker user group
sudo groupadd docker
# Add the logged-in user to the docker user group
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
# Update user group
newgrp docker
# Test if docker command is working properly
docker images
```

## 🤝 Frontend Development Guideline

1. Do not Destructure Pinia store.

   - The readability will be better when using `store`
   - Destructuring can lead to reactivity loss and using `storeToRefs` is also quite cumbersome

2. Avoid including UI logic in composables.

   - Such as `useMessage`
   - We categorize the router as UI logic, and for ease of testing, avoid including routerrelated logic in there
