00:00:02,186 --> 00:00:08,339
When I was young I'd listen to the radio

1
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:14,256
Waiting for my favorite songs

2
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:19,015
When they played I'd sing along

3
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:23,240
It made me smile

4
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:31,814
Those were such happy times and not so long ago 

5
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,962
How I wondered where they'd gone

6
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:43,725
But they're back again just like the long lost friend

7
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:48,743
All the songs I loved so well

8
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:52,457
Every sha-la-la-la

9
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:55,381
every woah-woah-woah

10
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:58,174
Still shines

11
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:03,987
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling

12
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:06,783
That they're starting to sing

13
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:09,567
so fine

14
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:15,146
When they get to the part

15
00:01:15,246 --> 00:01:18,158
Where he's breaking her heart

16
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:22,646
It can really make me cry

17
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:26,814
Just like before

18
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:35,997
It's yesterday once more

19
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:47,172
Looking back on how it was in years gone by

20
00:01:47,472 --> 00:01:52,270
And the good times that I had

21
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:58,013
Make today seem rather sad 

22
00:01:58,013 --> 00:02:02,812
So much has changed 

23
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:10,722
It was songs of love that I would sing to them 

24
00:02:10,915 --> 00:02:15,759
And I'd memorize each word 

25
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:22,454
Those old melodies still sound so good to me

26
00:02:22,454 --> 00:02:27,555
 As they melt the years away 

27
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,068
Every sha-la-la-la,

28
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,042
every woah-woah-woah 

29
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:37,050
Still shines 

30
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:42,135
 Every shing-a-ling-a-ling 

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,243
That they're starting to sing so fine 

32
00:02:50,876 --> 00:02:56,598
All my best memories come back clearly to me 

33
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:00,937
Some can even make me cry 

34
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:06,598
Just like before 

35
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:12,785
It's yesterday once more 

36
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:17,240
Every sha-la-la-la,

37
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,807
every woah-woah-woah 

38
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:23,198
Still shines 

39
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:28,639
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling 

40
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:35,859
That they're starting to sing so fine 

41
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:39,280
Every sha-la-la-la

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,500
every woah-woah-woah 

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:54,000
Still shines
